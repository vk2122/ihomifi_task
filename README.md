Task Description:
You are required to create an Alexa custom skill which will take the user's voice from the
Flutter app and trigger Alexa skill to do functionalities like turning on/off a light or switch
appliance.
The Flutter app UI can be very simple with a single screen and one button to capture the
user's voice and few card-like widgets to indicate lights or switch-like appliances, which
should change its colour when turned on/off.
